# Lantum frontend take home task

## Usage

- Made using `create-react-app`
- Clone the repo, cd into the file, `npm install`
- To run the application `npm start` to run the tests `npm run tests`

## If I had more time

- There are some things that I am not 100% happy with. For example, there is a duplicate line in the logic in order for both the tests and the application to run, I would like to remove this, or at least implement it slightly better.
- To add some additional CSS to make the page a little more aesthetically pleasing. Nothing too overt as functionality is more important than looks.
- A very small thing would be to move the 'user1' and other objects I used in the testing out to a separate folder. I think it would look much neater and be clearer.
